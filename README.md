# ILLiad_Alma_NCIP_Borrowing_V2
This is a System Addon for ILLiad allowing for the creation of items with brief records in Alma from ILLiad via NCIP, using barcodes in a selectable field.

This System Addon needs to be installed in the same directory as your regular Addons.  After setting up your configurations for the Addon, you will need to close your ILLiad Client for the configuration changes to take effect.
